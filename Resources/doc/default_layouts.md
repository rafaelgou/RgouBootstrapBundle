Layouts are extendable Twig templates with a page layout for reusing.

These layouts extends from base.html.twig and are defined in Resources/views,
with stylesheets and javascripts include for Twitter Bootstrap.

They are two basic:

- layout_local.html.twig: use only local resources 
- layout_cdn.html.twig: use CDN resources (Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery)
  ([BootstrapCDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) for Twitter Bootstrap and 
  [MediaTemple](http://code.jquery.com/) for jQuery)
